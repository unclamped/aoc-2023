i really don't think I'll be doing part 2, unless I feel particularly motivated one day to do it.
i'm starting to lose faith in this, this is my first year doing aoc, and even though this is supposed to be fun,
the only moments I have fun throughout the entire day where all I do is sit and do this, is when I get the answer right.
after I got done with part 1, I didn't even find joy in it, it was more like a relaxing moment of "it's over, finally".

in any case, my idea to finish it is to probably keep an array of my current seed number, and then add the elements of
the range to it. then, once I'm done with that one, clear it and move on to the next seed number and its range.

so, just as a note for future me, the diff with part 1 is that now, if the seed numbers were something like:
10 4 66 5, then the seeds would actually be 10, 11, 12, 13, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74.
of course, because the actual input's range is a LOT bigger, putting them all in a single array would immediately
kill the entire electricity the entire city. so, what if, using the example I gave of:
10 4 66 5
I had a variable like current_seed_number, with the 10, 11, 12, 13, and once I'm actually finished with those, I move to
the next one? so, I do all my dest number stuff for those four numbers, and then I clear it, add the ranges for 66 and 5,
so 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, and then do the same for that and for all the rest of seed numbers?
i don't know if I'll need even more optimization than that, but it seems like a doable solution at first. idk, I am tired,
it's 00:20.
